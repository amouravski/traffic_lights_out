This is a simple package that I use for writing games in 1 hour every week.

This will probably split off into something more complicated, but the initial goal of this is to provide:

  * A grid based layout with easy access to each grid cell and its neighbors
    * This should do all of the boundary checking for me given a coordinate pair
    * It should also be easy to interact with any of the grid elements, such as clicking and dragging.
  * An easy way to model global state in the context of win/lose conditions
  * A turn based or real-time animation loop to make games run
